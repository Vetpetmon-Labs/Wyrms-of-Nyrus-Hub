# VERSIONING
Wyrms of Nyrus uses its own versioning system to better help 
end users understand which versions are in Long Term Support(LTS), 
which ones are End of Life (EoL), which ones are Indev, and which are Stable.

We use the Major.Minor.Patch point-versioning formatting in Wyrms of Nyrus. 
Major versions are stable release candidates, 0 signifies beta/alpha. 
Minor versions denote that an update may or may not be backwards compatible. 
Patches are small changes like bugfixes or small content updates.

Generally speaking, every time Major and Minor points increment, 
you are expected to make a new world to prevent breaking changes.

## Indev
No-one but the devs, contributors, and donators see these builds. These 
builds are NOT production ready and should never be released publicly 
until determined to not contain breaking changes.

If breaking changes are unavoidable, the Indev build moves up a point 
in Minor, and Patch is reset to 0. When this happens, Stable gets switched 
to the Long Term Support status and model.

Indev is updated near-daily. Do not rely on it.

## Stable

These are not typically marked as any status in the Minor point-version. 
This is the active public releases pushed to Curseforge and Modrinth. 
They recieve full support and active content and feature updates.

Stable versions and branches exist up until the next Minor point-version 
has to be made indev. When this happens, they will become Long Term Support 
builds.

You can expect a new Stable version cycle twice a year.

## LTS

Long Term Support signifies that a version along the production line 
is no longer recieving larger content updates or new features. LTS 
versions are marked in the Minor point-version. Throughout the timeline, 
LTS versions recieve important bugfixes and minor adjustments.

Sometimes, if resources on the developers' ends are tied, a Stable 
version cycle will be declared End of Life.

You can expect a new LTS version cycle once a year. LTS typically 
lasts 4-6 more months after Stable versions reach LTS status.

## EoL

For users, End of Life versions of Wyrms of Nyrus should be avoided at all costs. 
Stable versions, if an LTS is not announced, will immediately fall into this category. 
After a new Stable version is released, the current LTS will become End of Life. 

No updates or support will be provided for these versions at all. Use them at 
your own risk.
